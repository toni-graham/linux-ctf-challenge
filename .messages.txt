Hello Admin,

The flag you seek is hidden in a system file. Try to find it!

Use the following command to view the flag:
    cat /etc/flag.txt

However, be warned. The file may not be as easy to access as it seems...

Look into the file permissions and ownership, and you may need to escalate your privileges.

Good luck,
The System
